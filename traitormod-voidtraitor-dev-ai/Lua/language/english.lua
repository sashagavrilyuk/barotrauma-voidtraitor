This is not a regular traitor server, but a varied and unique server.
It uses a custom Traitor Mod with many changes and full game modes.
Here we play Traitor missions, Attack & Defend, and sometimes suffer from chaos.

We also have a Discord server where I post when the server is open, and where you can download the menu mod for Traitor Mod.
P.S. There are also guides there, and you can suggest what else should be added to the server:
my server - https://discord.gg/rFrwmXg8DQ
partner server Project Encelada - https://discord.gg/encelada

For easier buying, you can install:
Traitor menu (requires client-side LUA together with C#)
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2990694897

(TYPE IN CHAT WITHOUT "/") Commands:
!help - shows the command list
!point - shows points, chance and lives
!pointshop / !shop / !ps - shop
!traitor - shows the objective list
!suicide / !kill - die.

Rules!!!
Do not be a jerk.
Do not grief or kill when you are not a traitor.
SECURITY AND CAPTAINS CANNOT BE TRAITORS!!]=]
